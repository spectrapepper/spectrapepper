@article{Oliva2016,
abstract = {Non-destructive characterization of both single layers and completed devices are important issues for the development of efficient and low cost Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 (CIGS) modules at high yields. This implies for the need of methodologies suitable for the assessment of optical, electrical, and physico-chemical parameters that are relevant for the final device efficiency and that can be used for quality control and process monitoring at different process steps. In these applications, detection of in-homogeneities in the different layers from large area modules is especially relevant, being the presence of these inhomogeneities responsible for the existing gap between the efficiencies achieved in these technologies at cell and module levels. In this context, this work reviews the different optical methodologies that have been developed in the framework of the SCALENANO European project for the advanced assessment of the different layers in high efficiency electrodeposited – based CIGS devices. This has includes different strategies as those based on Raman scattering, Photoluminescence/Electroluminescence (PL/EL) based techniques and new photoelectrochemical based tools and firstly Raman spectroscopy is very sensitive to both composition and crystal quality parameters that are determining for device efficiency. Use of resonant Raman excitation strategies allows achieving a high sensitivity of the Raman spectra to the analysed features in the different regions of the device. This involves selection of the suitable excitation wavelength (in the broad spectral region from UV to IR) for the resonant Raman excitation of the required layer in the device. The strong increase in the intensity of the Raman peaks related to the use of resonant excitation conditions allows also decreasing the measuring time to times compatible with the implementation of these techniques at online process monitoring level. Analysed parameters include the electrical conductivity of the Al-doped ZnO window layer, the thickness of the CdS buffer layer and the chemical composition (S/(S+Se) relative content) and presence of relevant secondary phases as Cu-poor ordered vacancy compounds in the surface region of the absorbers. In addition PL/EL imaging are powerful techniques that provide direct access to the optoelectronic properties of the materials and devices. Whereas EL is performed using complete devices by injecting current in analogy to the operation of a light emitting diode, PL allows the characterization of bare absorber materials without the need for any functional or contacting layers. Moreover, semiconductor photo-electrochemistry (PEC) is a versatile technique that enables many opto-electronic properties of semiconductors to be determined. Essentially, a semiconductor on a conducting substrate placed in a solution containing redox species forms a Schottky barrier junction. The formation of such a diode enables basic semiconductor properties to be measured such as doping type, doping density, band gap and the flat band position versus the vacuum energy scale. In all these cases, quality control indicators suitable for the advanced assessment of these processes have been identified and validated for the electrodeposition-based processes developed at Nexcis Company.},

This includes layers with thicknesses below 100 nm and compositions corresponding to Zn/(Zn + Mg) content rations in the range between 0% and 30%. The vibrational characterization of the layers grown with different compositions and thicknesses has allowed deepening in the knowledge of the sensitivity of the different Raman spectral features on the characteristics of the layers, corroborating the viability of resonant Raman scattering based techniques for their non-destructive quantitative assessment. This has included a deeper analysis of different experimental approaches for the quantitative assessment of the layer thickness, based on (a) the analysis of the intensity of the ZnMgO main Raman peak; (b) the evaluation of the changes of the intensity of the main Raman peak from the subjacent layer located below the ZnMgO one; and (c) the study of the changes in the relative intensity of the first to second/third order ZnMgO peaks. In all these cases, the implications related to the presence of quantum confinement effects in the nanocrystalline layers grown with different thicknesses have been discussed and evaluated.},

@article{Dimitrievska2019,
abstract = {Polycrystalline kesterite Cu2ZnSnSe4 (CZTSe) semiconductors have drawn attention as promising absorber candidates for the next generation of thin film photovoltaics. However, the narrow tolerance to stoichiometry variations, which favours the formation of secondary phases and cluster defects, is a challenging drawback that restrains the device performance. In this context Raman spectroscopy has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool for the characterization of CZTSe, allowing the assessment of relevant parameters such as structure, crystal quality and secondary phases. In this work, multiwavelength Raman scattering measurements using nine excitation wavelengths (from 325 to 1064 nm) were performed on CZTSe polycrystalline thin films in order to give a detailed identification of all the active Raman modes expected in this crystalline structure. The experimental results compare well with the vibrational properties that have been computed by first-principles calculations based on density functional theory. Calculations of the phonon density of states (PDOS), as well as the simulation of the Raman spectra, have allowed a better understanding of the experimentally observed vibrational modes. A "non-band gap resonant" Raman effect was observed under 325 nm excitation conditions, making ultra-violet (UV) Raman spectroscopy a very promising characterization technique due to its high sensitivity to the surface region which provides information on the buffer/absorber interface. Strong intensity enhancement of spectral regions around 176 cm-1 and 250 cm-1 is observed. Calculated PDOS and combinatorial experiments on more than 200 samples with stoichiometries close to the high efficiency device compositions lead to the correlation of these intensities with the concentration of VCu and ZnSn point defects, respectively. Correlation with the optoelectronic properties of the devices allowed identification of the optimal concentration of VCu and ZnSn point defects for the highest performance devices. The application of the presented methodology has been confirmed by performing the same Raman analysis on the CZTSe absorber with 11% device efficiency. This work demonstrates that defect engineering in CZTSe is of the foremost importance for the improvement of solar cell performance, and that UV-based Raman spectroscopy is an effective technique for the non-destructive assessment of defects in kesterite materials.},

@article{Chopra2004,
abstract = {Thin film solar cells (TFSC) are a promising approach for terrestrial and space photovoltaics and offer a wide variety of choices in terms of the device design and fabrication. A variety of substrates (flexible or rigid, metal or insulator) can be used for deposition of different layers (contact, buffer, absorber, reflector, etc.) using different techniques (PVD, CVD, BCD, plasma-based, hybrid, etc.). Such versatility allows tailoring and engineering of the layers in order to improve device performance. For large-area devices required for realistic applications, thin-film device fabrication becomes complex and requires proper control over the entire process sequence. Proper understanding of thin-film deposition processes can help in achieving high-efficiency devices over large areas, as has been demonstrated commercially for different cells. Research and development in new, exotic and simple materials and devices, and innovative, but simple manufacturing processes need to be pursued in a focussed manner. Which cell(s) and which technologies will ultimately succeed commercially continue to be anybody's guess, but it would surely be determined by the simplicity of manufacturability and the cost per reliable watt. Cheap and moderately efficient TFSC are expected to receive a due commercial place under the sun. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Solar cells based on quaternary kesterite compounds like Cu2ZnGeSe4are complex systems where the variation of one parameter can result in changes in the whole system, and, as consequence, in the global performance of the devices. In this way, analyses that take into account this complexity are necessary in order to overcome the existing limitations of this promising Earth-abundant photovoltaic technology. This study presents a combinatorial approach for the analysis of Cu2ZnGeSe4based solar cells. A compositional graded sample containing almost 200 solar cells with different [Zn]/[Ge] compositions is analyzed by means of X-ray fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy, and the results are correlated with the optoelectronic parameters of the different cells. The analysis results in a deep understanding of the stoichiometric limits and point defects formation in the Cu2ZnGeSe4compound, and shows the influence of these parameters on the performance of the devices. Then, intertwined connections between the compositional, vibrational and optoelectronic properties of the cells are revealed using a complex analytical approach. This is further extended using a machine learning algorithm. The latter confirms the correlation between the properties of the Cu2ZnGeSe4compound and the optoelectronic parameters, and also allows proposing a methodology for device performance prediction that is compatible with both research and industrial process monitoring environments. As such, this work not only provides valuable insights for understanding and further developing the Cu2ZnGeSe4photovoltaic technology, but also gives a practical example of the potential of combinatorial analysis and machine learning for the study of complex systems in materials research.},

abstract = {Successful materials innovations can transform society. However, materials research often involves long timelines and low success probabilities, dissuading investors who have expectations of shorter times from bench to business. A combination of emergent technologies could accelerate the pace of novel materials development by ten times or more, aligning the timelines of stake-holders (investors and researchers), markets, and the environment, while increasing return on investment. First, tool automation enables rapid experimental testing of candidate materials. Second, high-performance computing concentrates experimental bandwidth on promising compounds by predicting and inferring bulk, interface, and defect-related properties. Third, machine learning connects the former two, where experimental outputs automatically refine theory and help define next experiments. We describe state-of-the-art attempts to realize this vision and identify resource gaps. We posit that over the coming decade, this combination of tools will transform the way we perform materials research, with considerable first-mover advantages at stake. The development of novel materials has long been stymied by a mismatch of time constants (Figure 1). Materials development typically occurs over a 15-to 25-year time horizon, sometimes requiring synthesis and characterization of millions of samples. However, corporate and government funders desire tangible results within the residency time of their leadership, typically 2-5 years. The residency time for postdocs and students in a research laboratory is usually 2-5 years; when a project outlasts the residency of a single individual, seamless continuity of motivation and intellectual property is often the exception, not the rule. Market drivers of novel materials development, informed by business competition and environmental considerations , often demand solutions within a shorter time horizon. This mismatch in time constants results in a historically poor return on investment of energy-materials (cleantech) research relative to comparable investments in medical or software development. 1 To bridge this mismatch in time horizons and increase the success rate of materials research, both public-and private-sector actors endeavor to develop new paradigms for materials development. 2},

@article{Barton2019,
abstract = {Cosmic ray artifacts may be present in all photo-electric readout systems. In spectroscopy, they present as random unidirectional sharp spikes that distort spectra and may have an affect on post-processing, possibly affecting the results of multivariate statistical classification. A number of methods have previously been proposed to remove cosmic ray artifacts from spectra but the goal of removing the artifacts while making no other change to the underlying spectrum is challenging. One of the most successful and commonly applied methods for the removal of comic ray artifacts involves the capture of two sequential spectra that are compared in order to identify spikes. The disadvantage of this approach is that at least two recordings are necessary, which may be problematic for dynamically changing spectra, and which can reduce the signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio when compared with a single recording of equivalent duration due to the inclusion of two instances of read noise. In this paper, a cosmic ray artefact removal algorithm is proposed that works in a similar way to the double acquisition method but requires only a single capture, so long as a data set of similar spectra is available. The method employs normalized covariance in order to identify a similar spectrum in the data set, from which a direct comparison reveals the presence of cosmic ray artifacts, which are then replaced with the corresponding values from the matching spectrum. The advantage of the proposed method over the double acquisition method is investigated in the context of the S/N ratio and is applied to various data sets of Raman spectra recorded from biological cells.},

@article{Whitaker2018,
abstract = {Raman Spectroscopy is a widely used analytical technique, favoured when molecular specificity with minimal sample preparation is required. The majority of Raman instruments use charge-coupled device (CCD) detectors, these are susceptible to cosmic rays and as such multiple spurious spikes can occur in the measurement. These spikes are problematic as they may hinder subsequent analysis, particularly if multivariate data analysis is required. In this work we present a new algorithm to remove these spikes from spectra after acquisition. Specifically, our algorithm uses modified Z scores calculated from the once-differenced detrended spectrum to locate the offending spikes, followed by a simple moving average to remove them. The algorithm is very simple and its execution is essentially instantaneous, resulting in spike-free spectra with minimal distortion of actual Raman data. The presented algorithm represents an improvement on existing spike removal methods by utilising simple, easy to understand mathematical concepts, making it ideal for experts and non-experts alike.},
